        <h2>RSA</h2>
        <p>RSA algorithm is an asymmetric cryptography algorithm. Asymmetric means that it works on two different keys i.e. Public Key and Private Key. As the name describes the Public Key is given to everyone and the Private Key is kept private.</p>

        <h2>EL GAMAL</h2>
        <p>ElGamal is an asymmetric cryptography algorithm used primarily for encryption and digital signatures. Like RSA, it involves two keys: a public key and a private key. It is based on the Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP), which makes it secure against brute-force attacks.</p>
